# Dummy GitHub Exercise!

**Introduction**
---
Recently, I created this repository, and I've practiced the very basic **Git** concepts and **commands** in it! Actually, you can't find something fancy!
Though you are not obligated to follow along! Of COURSE!!!
Let's tell you what I've done here and what commands I practiced here: 


```
git status
```
- To check the working tree status

```
git init
```
- Creates new repository wherever we are. Before creating a new repo, use `git status` command to check if you are not in another repo.

```
git add .
```
- Stages all the changes until now. However, we could selectively stage the changes using `git add <file-name>`.

```
git commit -m "commit-name"
```
- Commit the staged changes

```
git log
```
- Now, you can use this command to know who and when changed the environment and see the commits.
